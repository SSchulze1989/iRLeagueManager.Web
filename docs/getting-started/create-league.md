To create your own league click on the **Create League** on the bottom of the iRleagueManager main page:

![Create League Button](img/create_league_button_light.png#only-light){width="600px"}
![Create League Button](img/create_league_button_dark.png#only-dark){width="600px"}

Or head directly to [https://irleaguemanager.net/createleague](https://irleaguemanager.net/createleague).

First you will be asked to enter a name and optionally a more concise **Strong name** for your league. 

The strong name has to be unique and will serve as a part of the address to your league pages. 
Therefore the **Strong name** should be short an can only contain characters that are valid in a URL.

For example you could enter **My Awesome Race League** as the name and **awesome-league** as the strong name.

## Selecting a league template

After entering your name you will be forwarded to the league settings page immediately. 

!!! warning
    If you are not automatically forwarded please navigate manually to **https://irleaguemanager.net/[strong-name]/settings/league**.

If you visit your league settings page for the first time you will be asked to select a league template.

![League Template Selection](img/select_league_template_dark.png#only-dark){width="450px"}

You can decide to chose one of the existing templates or start with a blank league. For new users it is recommended to start with a template because the most important settings are already configured for you.

## Basic League Settings

After selecting a template you will be able to see the basic league settings page. Here you can configure the displayed league name, add a description and manage your seasons.

!!! note
    Your newly create league will be hidden for other visitors first. 
    Once you are done with the initial configuration you can make it visible to the public by clicking on the **Make Public** button at the top of the page.

## First season

By default a new league already has a default season with an empty schedule configured:

If you want to change the name of the season you can do so change this on the league settings page. 
Simply click on the name of the Season and it will open a popup where you can change the name.

Next you should create your Schedule for the season.
