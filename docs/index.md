### Description
Online sim racing has become increasingly popular among both hobbyists and professionals, with iRacing standing out as one of the leading platforms for competitive racing. Many participants choose to organize private leagues, whether to enhance the spirit of competition, recreate historic championships, or simply enjoy racing with friends.

Although iRacing offers basic support for leagues and scoring, its features are limited compared to the wide range of race formats and points systems that many leagues wish to use. As a result, organizers often export results from iRacing and rely on third-party solutions to manage and host their scoring. These solutions can range from simple spreadsheets to comprehensive result hosting platforms. However, managing spreadsheets can quickly become tedious and time-consuming, especially as leagues grow and the volume of results increases. Additionally, many leagues implement their own penalty systems, which require further manual adjustments for points deductions or time penalties.

**iRLeagueManager is providing such a service for scoring and hosting your league results all-in-one.**

Once configured the software can generate results and standings, apply penalty points and publish to your website all with the click of one button, 
you can generate extensive statistics and metrics spanning over years of races with minimal amount of effort and the build in reviews and stewarding 
system gives a home to after race discussions about incidents and can also apply automatic penalty points based on a incident category system.
Finally you can either use the webapp directly to share the results with the world or if you already have a league webpage use the API to publish the data in real time.

### Features

*   **Highly Flexible Scoring Configurations**  
    iRLeagueManager supports a wide variety of race formats, including heat races, team races, and multiclass events. You can define multiple result configurations per event (e.g., Pro/AM or multiclass scoring), use custom filters to generate result sets, and apply different points calculation methods-all within the same platform.

*	**Automated Standings and Penalty Management**  
    The system automates the calculation of standings and the application of penalty points, including bonus points (for position, pole, least incidents, etc.) and automatic penalties for incidents. This reduces manual work and ensures consistent results.

*	**Integrated Stewarding and Review System**  
    iRLeagueManager includes a built-in review system for registering incidents, discussing them with other stewards, and finalizing results. It also supports automatic penalty points based on incident categories and provides a protest form for drivers to report incidents.

*	**Open REST API**  
    The platform offers a fully open REST API, allowing you to access 100% of your league data and integrate it with your own website or tools in real time.

*	**Role-Based Access Control**  
    Manage different user roles (admins, organizers, stewards) with a robust role-based access system, ensuring the right people have the right permissions.

*	**User-Friendly Web Interface**  
    The web-based interface is designed for ease of use, enabling league administrators to configure, manage, and publish results with minimal effort.

*	**Comprehensive Statistics and Metrics**  
    Generate extensive statistics and metrics spanning years of races, helping you analyze performance and trends over time.

*	**All-in-One Solution**  
    Unlike many other tools that require exporting data to spreadsheets or using multiple platforms, iRLeagueManager provides an integrated environment for scoring, results hosting, reviews, and data publishing.
    These features make iRLeagueManager a powerful and flexible choice for league administrators who want to streamline their scoring and results management processes.
